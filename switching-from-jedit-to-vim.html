editor, I have switched to <a href="http://vim.org">Vim</a> because of its lower
computational requirements, its ability to function in a text-only environment
(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529074752/http://www.frexx.de:80/xterm-256-notes/">256-color terminals</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091209222635/http://www.jmcpherson.org/screen.html">terminal
multiplexers</a> for the win!), and its
efficient <em>modal</em> approach to text entry, navigation, and manipulation.</p>
<p>But what really spurred this sudden change? It was an inferior CPU.</p>
<p>I bought an <a href="http://www.silentpcreview.com/zotac-ion">NVIDIA ION system with the Intel Atom N330
processor</a> last year and built a
<em>silent</em>, low-power desktop (33 Watts total!) that could still play HD movies.
I don&rsquo;t play computer games anymore so this was sufficient for my programming
needs, or so I thought&hellip;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this new system was sickeningly underpowered (CPU wise) as
jEdit literally began to crawl. It would lag when displaying text that I had
typed on the screen, and would pause momentarily before scrolling the text
buffer to the next or previous page. This was clearly unacceptable!</p>
<p>Luckily, I was reasonably comfortable with Vim because I had been using it to
make quick edits (whenever I was in a terminal) for the past six years. So
this time, I decided to seriously learn it, once and for all.</p>
<p>After a few days of self-reprogramming, I had <a href="http://github.com/sunaku/.vim">a heavily customized
Vim</a> with easier jEdit-like shortcuts and the
ability to install Vim plugins neatly. I had completely switched to Vim.</p>
<p>Now I <em>truly am</em> a terminal dwelling, modal editing Linux geek! :-]</p>
