Love</a>, I noticed that in order for two
people (each with their own umbrella) to embrace, one of them must first
sacrifice their umbrella, become wet in the rain, and finally get underneath
the other&rsquo;s umbrella. Otherwise, as the two people draw near, their umbrellas
will collide and prevent them from embracing, as shown in the film.</p>
<p>I felt happy to understand the symbolic meaning of that scene: in order to
advance or improve in life, one must let go of or sacrifice one&rsquo;s safe and
comfortable environment. If one is unwilling to perform such sacrifice but
still wants to advance, then one is foolish, illusioned and will not succeed
in any attempts at advancement. In fact, such a person is forever tormented by
their desires, just as a spoiled child throws a tantrum, is unable to think,
and increases his sorrow when he is not given what he wants.</p>
<p>Therefore, be not afraid of the chilling rain! Sacrifice your umbrella and
proceed forth, towards your destiny!</p>
