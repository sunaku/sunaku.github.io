Women&rsquo;s roles as people moved from traditional farming societies to big
industrial cities. Women in wealthy families were more so bound to their
homes, while those in poor families worked long hours for minuscule wages in
the emerging Victorian society.</p>
<p>As industrialization emerged, men went to work in factories while women were
left behind to perform domestic work. This separation of work and home reduced
the economic importance of women at home, as they &ldquo;no longer learned craft and
productive skills from their fathers and husbands&rdquo; (Bradley, 1996:127). Women
in poor families were economically forced to work outside the home. Many of
whom worked as Governesses, which was &ldquo;ill-paid and commanded little social
respect&rdquo; (Bradley, 1996:140), and &ldquo;ended up as paupers or dependent on
charity&rdquo; (Bradley, 1996:140). For example, &ldquo;In 1851 there were over a million
women servants&rdquo; (Bradley, 1996:134). In contrast, women from wealthy families
were only allowed to perform &ldquo;unpaid charitable work, visiting the sick, and
improving the lives and morals of their working class sisters&rdquo; (Bradley,
1996:140) under the male-dominated Victorian society.</p>
<p>Job opportunities for women were shortened by sexual division of labor, as
industrial employers would give them &ldquo;women&rsquo;s work&rdquo; that consisted of
&ldquo;repetitive and unskilled&rdquo; tasks (Bradley, 1996:141). In addition to a narrow
choice of work, women faced horrible working conditions and long hours for
miniscule wages. In pre-industrial economy, &ldquo;spinning was a major female
occupation while weaving was a traditional male skill&rdquo; (Bradley, 1996:141).
However, the use of machines during the Industrial era took the role of
spinning, and women were now assigned the role of weaving (Bradley, 1996:141).</p>
<p>The imposition of stereotyped gender roles by Victorian society had
established strong patriarchy in Northwest Europe. Women were becoming more
powerless as they received extremely low pay for their work and became
dependent on men (Bradley, 1996:140). Bradley notes &ldquo;Sex segregation of jobs
became a major vehicle for the continuing social dominance of men&rdquo; (Bradley,
1996:142). Through the use of sexual stereotypes such as women&rsquo;s &ldquo;intellect is
not for invention or creation, but for a sweet ordering, arrangement and
decision&rdquo; (Bradley, 1996:140), Victorian society had essentially segregated
women from economic freedom and bound them into a strongly male-dominated
society.</p>
<p>Prior to industrialization women were more valued as they were an important
contributor to family income. With the coming of Industrialization and
establishment of Victorian ideology, women were restricted to domestic work by
discrimination and poor wages in the workplace.</p>
