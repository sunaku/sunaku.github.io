a cornerstone of the modern Software Engineering discipline, especially in the
Ruby programming world.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I felt that I had remained a TDD spectator for too long and
decided to jump on the TDD bandwagon once and for all. Under TDD, my Ruby on
Rails application progressed slowly but reliably and I experienced a newfound
sense of confidence and euphoria whilst developing it.</p>
<p>Alas, the good times soon turned sour, as my tests took longer to run with
each passing day (and the number of new tests I wrote therein). Things could
not go on this way if I were to continue practicing TDD, so I began looking
for ways of continuously running tests using the fork/eval approach, where the
test execution overhead would be absorbed by the continuous testing daemon and
my tests would thereby run very quickly.</p>
<p>I tried <a href="http://ph7spot.com/musings/getting-started-with-autotest">AutoTest</a>
first, but soon noticed that it shelled-out to Ruby in order to run tests,
meaning that it did not absorb the test execution overhead as I hoped.
Instead, all it did was to automatically perform the equivalent of <code>rake test</code>
whenever my source files changed.</p>
<p>Next I tried <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100329004933/http://mynyml.com:80/ruby/flexible-continuous-testing">Watchr</a>,
whose examples suggested that it, like autotest, was best for shelling-out to
Ruby to run tests whenever my source files changed.</p>
<p>Finally, I gave up on the search and instead created my own continuous testing
tool called <a href="http://github.com/sunaku/test-loop">test-loop</a> which follows the
forementioned fork/eval approach to speed up test execution. With this tool, I
am now more productive with TDD than ever because my tests <em>finish running</em>
within seconds after I save my source code! TDD FTW :-)</p>

attention lately. To quell my jealousy, I wrote <a href="https://gist.github.com/1352391">this simple 27-line

testing efficiency just like my <a href="http://github.com/sunaku/test-loop">test-loop</a> tool. However, it uses a TCP based server/client model, where the
continous testing daemon is the server and clients connect to it to schedule
runs of particular tests. In my opinion, it has the right idea (fork/eval) but
its implementation (server/client) seems to be overkill.</p>
