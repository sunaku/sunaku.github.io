of Vedic and Upanishadic philosophy while defining his own [1]. In particular,
he skillfully transforms the concepts of Aathman<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>, Brahman, Samsaara, Kharma,
Dharma, and Moksha into two primary forms of discipline: Yoga and Bhakthi.</p>

<div id="introduction" class="section"></div><h2 class="heading">Introduction<a href="#introduction" class="permalink" title="Permalink"></a><a href="#__introduction__" class="uplink" title="Contents"></a></h2>
<p>Yoga, defined as an act or state of morality and contemplation [1], is the
primary vehicle which delivers one from chaos, ignorance, and the cycle of
rebirth into peace, wisdom, and the infinite spirit according to Krishna [2].
Bhakthi, defined as devotion [1], is the religious aspect of Krishna&rsquo;s
dialogue in the Bhagavadh Giitha through which one becomes detached from
desires, delusions, emotion, and acts of consciousness through thinking,
praying, and meditating on the Gods [1, 2]. Yoga and Bhakthi should not be
thought of as being two disjoint, unrelated concepts, for as Krishna explains
[2, p. 67]:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The self tranquil, his fear dispelled,            <br>
firm in his vow of celibacy, his mind restrained, <br>
let him sit with discipline,                      <br>
his thought fixed upon me, intent on me.          <br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, the first three lines refer to Yoga while the last line refers to
Bhakthi. One can see that Yoga is essential to performing Bhakthi optimally,
and performance of Bhakthi enhances one&rsquo;s Yoga because one&rsquo;s mind is
indifferent to environmental and personal influences when all of one&rsquo;s
thoughts are fixed away, upon something. Thus, in the subsequent discussion,
one should keep in mind that whenever Yoga is detailed, Bhakthi is also
detailed implicitly; and vice versa.</p>

<div id="vedic-influence" class="section"></div><h2 class="heading">Vedic Influence<a href="#vedic-influence" class="permalink" title="Permalink"></a><a href="#__vedic-influence__" class="uplink" title="Contents"></a></h2>
<p>The Vedic concepts of Samsaara, Kharma, and Dharma are well supported in the
Bhagavadh Giitha with numerous examples of social and personal
responsibilities. For example, when Arjuna—dejected by the sight of his
kinsmen ready to battle against him [2, p. 27–29]—is unwilling to fight, he
says [2, p. 29]:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The sins of men who violate           <br>
the family create disorder in society <br>
that undermines the constant laws     <br>
of caste and family duty.             <br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we see clearly the influence of Vedic Kharma in the phrase &ldquo;the constant
laws of caste and family duty,&rdquo; because Vedic Kharma was used to support the
caste system of the four Varnas [1]. Influence of Vedic Samsaara is also
present with this quotation&rsquo;s reference to bringing disorder as a sin, because
it was believed in Vedic culture that without performance of Vedic fire
sacrifices, the world would go into chaos and calamity [1]—an undesirable
event in Vedic philosophy [1]. Finally, Vedic Dharma is present as Krishna
encourages Arjuna to selflessly perform and fulfill his duties as a warrior
because such is a warrior&rsquo;s Dharma [2, p. 36]:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>nothing is better for a warrior <br>
than a battle of sacred duty.   <br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, Arjuna&rsquo;s reluctance to perform his warrior&rsquo;s Dharma is the very
problem the Bhagavadh Giitha strives to resolve.</p>

<div id="upanishadic-influence" class="section"></div><h2 class="heading">Upanishadic Influence<a href="#upanishadic-influence" class="permalink" title="Permalink"></a><a href="#__upanishadic-influence__" class="uplink" title="Contents"></a></h2>
<p>The Upanishadic concepts of Aathman, Brahman, and Moksha are well supported
through the treatment of numerous philosophical questions, concepts, and
abstract thought in the Bhagavadh Giitha, primarily because the Upanishads
themselves dealt with such abstract, philosophical concepts [1, 4, 3].</p>
<p>Aathman, or the inner self, is described by Krishna when he philosophically
encourages Arjuna to follow his warrior&rsquo;s Dharma by explaining that the
Aathman cannot be killed [2, p. 34]:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Arjuna, when a man knows the self       <br>
to be indestructible, enduring, unborn, <br>
unchanging, how does he kill            <br>
or cause anyone to kill?                <br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this manner, Krishna motivates the practice of Dharma and Yoga because the
self has nothing to lose, so to speak. That is, even if one dies while
practicing one&rsquo;s Dharma and Yoga, one&rsquo;s self persists nevertheless [2, p. 71]:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fallen in discipline, he reaches             <br>
worlds made by his virtue, wherein he dwells <br>
for endless years, until he is reborn        <br>
in a house of upright and noble men.         <br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brahman, or the infinite spirit, is thoroughly discussed in the eighteenth
teaching of the Bhagavadh Giitha. Here, Krishna hints about the Upanishadic
origin of Brahman when he describes it as &ldquo;the state ascetics enter, freed
from passion,&rdquo; [2, p. 81]—the Upanishads were developed by ascetics [1]—and
states that one can invoke it via the &ldquo;eternal syllable OM&rdquo; [2, p. 81]—the
Vedic eternal syllable consisted only of the letter O until the Upanishads
appended the letter M onto it [1]. In addition, Krishna frequently connects
Brahman to Yoga for he states that one requires discipline to reach Brahman
[2, p. 80]:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Disciplined through practice,     <br>
his reason never straying,        <br>
meditating, one reaches           <br>
the supreme divine spirit of man. <br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moksha, or liberation from the cycle of rebirth [1], is described by Krishna
when he says [2, p. 80]:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>with the mind immovable, <br>
armed with devotion      <br>
[&hellip;]                    <br>
one attains the supreme  <br>
divine spirit of man.    <br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, Krishna relates Moksha to Yoga in the first line by requiring that only
those who possess complete mental resolve through Yoga can achieve Moksha.
Similarly, he relates Moksha to Bhakthi in the second line by requiring that
only those with complete devotion can achieve Moksha.</p>

<p>As we have seen through various examples, the central tenets of Vedic and
Upanishadic philosophy are borrowed from heavily and incorporated in the
Bhagavadh Giitha; particularly in describing Bhakthi and Yoga, the two primary
forms of discipline.</p>
