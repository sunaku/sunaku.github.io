Africa. This virus is <em>zoonotic</em>, which means it stays on an animal host until
it is passed onto another host. The Ebola HF virus belongs to a family of
viruses called <em>Filoviridae</em> which divides up into four known strains: Ebola
Zaire, Ebola Sudan, Ebola Ivory Coast, and Ebola Reston [1]. All four strains
have no vaccination, and still claim victims in isolated areas of Africa such
as Gabon, Sudan, and Zaire (also known as The Democratic Republic of the
Congo). When cynomolgous monkeys infected with Ebola Reston were shipped from
the Philippines to the United States and Italy for research, an outbreak
occurred and some researchers were exposed to the virus. Fortunately the Ebola
Reston did not affect humans, but it did affect the cynomolgous monkeys and
other primates.</p>
<p>Although the natural reservoir (the place Ebola HF originated from) of Ebola
HF is unknown, the virus was first found in 1976 in the small Bandundu
province near the Ebola River in Zaire (now known as The Democratic Republic
of the Congo). In this first outbreak, the number of deaths among the 318
infected people (Ebola Zaire) was 88% [2]. Later that year another smaller
breakout occurred in Southern Sudan where 53% of the 284 infected people
(Ebola Sudan) died [3].</p>
<p>The process of being infected by the Ebola HF virus from another person has
yet to be understood, but the symptoms and ways of transmission of the disease
are known. During the first few days of infection, most patients will have
fevers, joint pains, and diarrhea. Some patients will have sore throat, skin
rashes; bloody diarrhea, red and itchy eyes, and hiccups. During the last days
of infection, most patients will have chest pain, and shock. Some patients
become blind and bleed in their digestive tract in the last hours of their
life.</p>
<p>Transmitting the virus between humans requires some person has to have touched
an animal carrying the virus. Then that person would go and touch his family
and friends, and so on. Some common ways of transferring the virus from person
to person are: touching and handling used needles with bodily liquids still on
them, touching any bodily liquids of the carrier, touching dead victims,
touching infected people&rsquo;s bleeding wounds or skin rashes, and even touching
or wearing their clothes.</p>
<p>In the fight for a cure for Ebola HF, several procedures were created to
identify the disease in patients. The lgG ELISA (Antigen-Capture-Enzyme-
Linked-Immunosorbent Assay) laboratory procedure is used to test patients for
virus infection [4]. This specific procedure is a part of a pathogen testing
protocol called ELISA (Enzyme-Linked-Immunosorbent Serologic Assay) [4]. It
detects specific substances such as viruses, pathogens, and other infectious
disease. There are no developed vaccines for any strain of Ebola HF virus, but
there are many people who have survived the disease. The disease can be
prevented if people are careful around needles, and dead victims, and if they
are infected, they should see the doctor right away for the lgG ELISA
procedure. There are a few cases of success, for example, in Kikwit, Zairevii
in 1995, seven out of eight infected patients lived when they were given blood
from patients who had survived the disease. This data seems promising, but
there were too few people to experiment with, and each person had his/her own
qualities which could have greatly affected his/her outcome. For this reason,
this data was considered useless by the CDC9.</p>
<p>According to the CDC [6], African health-care facilities are not the best
places to get help for an Ebola HF infection. Patients are often cared for
without protection such as masks and gloves, and they are exposed to the same
clothes that physicians wear while treating those who are dying. Needles and
syringes are not sterilized or thrown away; instead they are simply rinsed
with water and reused again. For example, a blood sample would be taken from a
dying person, and then the needle would be rinsed and used to inject into a
vial of medicine into another person. I think it is naive that these
physicians look past such simple things as sterilization. They are infecting
more people rather than saving them [5].</p>
<p>The African health-care facilities need more attention from world
organizations such as the Red Cross, CARE, and the CDCix. People need to be
aware of the conditions in these facilities so we can help the facilities
incorporate standard sterilization procedures. This will significantly reduce
the number of deaths due to bio-hazardous medical equipment. The facilities
and these organizations can also invoke public support, to raise money, and
get food for those suffering from the disease and their families. Also, if
more biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies invest in medical research
they could greatly profit; this will give the researchers funding so they can
start work on finding a cure for the disease.</p>
<p>I believe that the African health-care facilities need to incorporate standard
sterilization techniques before caring for patients. The Ebola HF virus needs
to be further researched so that a cure can be found. And people of the world
need to be more aware of this disease. After all, those who are suffering are
human, and if we don&rsquo;t help them survive, who will be left to help us?</p>
