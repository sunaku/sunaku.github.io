Europe and yet did not dominate the world by the 19th century. Scrutiny of
social values, government structure, and national objectives can help explain
why.</p>
<p>Technologically, China was far more advanced than Europe during the Sung
Dynasty. Paper and printing, advanced ship designs, gunpowder, the magnetic
compass, and the clock are some notable Chinese scientific innovations of this
era. Water and buffalo driven machines, as advanced as 18th century Europe,
powered China&rsquo;s salt drilling industry (Nova, 1990). Zeng He, the great
Chinese explorer, owned a treasure fleet of 317 ships &ldquo;the largest of which
were four hundred feet long (compared with eighty-five feet of Columbus&rsquo;s
Santa Maria)&rdquo; (Stokes, 2001:4). China&rsquo;s centralized government promoted such
innovations, while Europe, strongly divided among quarreling nation-states,
could not.</p>
<p>Much of China&rsquo;s technological progress was made possible by its social
structure which held scholars, civil servants, and even farmers socially above
merchants. The Chinese had an honor based society in which becoming a highly
educated civil servant to improve general welfare was more desirable than
making money. Even the sons of wealthy merchants would abandon their family
business and study to become civil servants (Nova, 1990). They were inspired
by &lsquo;selfless officials&rsquo; such as the great scholar Li Bing and explorer Zeng
He. Li Bing devised a series of dams which prevented damage from seasonal
floods near Beijing (Nova, 1990). Zeng He made seven great voyages on the
Indian ocean as far as Madagascar (Stokes, 2001:5). In contrast, the
capitalist European society valued entrepreneurship over scholarship. Scarce
natural resources, capitalistic ideology, and the promise of abundant wealth
in Asia and slave trade in Africa, gave Europeans an incentive for
Imperialism.</p>
<p>After the Ming dynasty arose, foreign exploration, astrological research, and
overseas exploration were strongly discouraged. For example, Zeng He&rsquo;s massive
treasure fleet and the Chinese navy were disbanded and the ships were left to
rot (Nova, 1990). Instead, the Ming rulers attended to internal political
problems and promoting agriculture. For example, the Ming issued for the
extension of the Grand Canal from Hangdou to Beijing (Nova, 1990). This
inward-looking stance led to a &ldquo;systematic resistance to learning from other
cultures&rdquo; (Stokes, 2001:2) was China&rsquo;s greatest handicap, argues Landes
(Stokes, 2001:2). In contrast, Europeans had the &ldquo;ability to assimilate
knowledge from around the world and put it to use&rdquo; (Stokes, 2001:2). This
handicap had isolated China from new technology and territorial expansion, as
Europe, without a central government to discourage exploration, began their
Imperialistic campaigns in the 19th century.</p>
<p>Differences in social values, government structure, and national objectives
can be used to explain why China did not dominate the world by 19th century.
However, it was mostly due to the decision of Ming rulers of halting foreign
affairs, exploration, and astrological research that China did not dominate
the world.</p>
